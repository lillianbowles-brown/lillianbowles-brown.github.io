            This one-page site is my Tech Moms project and a snapshot of where I am right now:
            blending my background in financial services, small business, community work,
            and education with new skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m using this space to explore how tech, data, and storytelling can support
                social good and open up new career possibilities.

        <!-- ABOUT ME (OPTION 1) -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a first-generation, non-traditional Univeristy of Utah graduate who spent 15+ years in financial
                services and 10 years running a successful e-commerce business before returning to
                school. I earned my B.S. in Political Science and Sociology, Cum Laude, driven by
                curiosity, a love of learning, and a desire to understand people, systems, and
                social impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                I previously served as an AmeriCorps VISTA with the Utah Refugee Services Office
                and Women of the World, where I supported program evaluation, community building,
                leadership development, and volunteer coordination. This experience strengthened
                my interest in data, strategy, and the role that research plays in creating
                meaningful impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a full-time caregiver for my mother while continuing to build my
                technical and leadership skills. Even in this season of caregiving, I remain
                committed to lifelong learning—exploring tech, data, AI tools, and policy to better
                understand how technology can support community impact and expand future career
                possibilities.

            <h2>What’s Next</h2>
            <p>
                Tech Moms helped me see that I don’t have to choose between tech, policy, or social
                impact — I can build a path that brings all of them together. Over the next year,
                I’m focusing on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deepening my skills in AI prompt work and applied AI tools.</li>
                <li>Building a stronger foundation in data analytics, including forecasting and data storytelling.</li>
                <li>Job shadowing different tech roles to better understand where my strengths fit.</li>
                <li>Collaborating on a data project exploring election outcomes using Votebuilder with the Executive
                    Director of the Salt Lake County Democrats.</li>
                <li>Continuing the Women’s Leadership Institute Political Development Series and applying what I learn
                    at the intersection of leadership, policy, and tech.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I’m excited to keep experimenting, learning, and finding the spaces where my love
                for people, data, and impact can come together.
